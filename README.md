# ARCannon

This is a simple AR game made using Unity3D, vuforia SDK and then Android Studio and Xcode for build to mobile platforms.

Most of the scripting was done in C# with a few modifications to native JavaScript scripts. 

Unity3D and XCode/Android Studio is required to build this project to iOS and Android respectively. The stonehires image is used as a marker for the app so the user would need to print that out and point the camera at it for the game stage to be set up. 

The game was developed with mobile platforms (hence the virtual buttons) in mind but it can be very easily modified to work with PCs and VR headsets.
